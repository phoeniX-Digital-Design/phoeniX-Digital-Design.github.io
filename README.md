## About

We are a research team located in the [Electronics Research Center](https://erc.iust.ac.ir/index.php?sid=45&slc_lang=fa) at Iran University of Science and Technology, specializing in computer architecture, high-performance computing, and fault-tolerance in embedded systems. We are passionate about exploring new ideas and developing cutting-edge solutions in these fields. Our projects are freely available and open-source, providing accessibility to individuals interested in embedded systems and VLSI. Our projects are available at our [GitHub page](https://github.com/phoeniX-Digital-Design) and repositories are equipped with thorough documentation, user manuals, and detailed information, facilitating user-friendly navigation and ease of use.
 
The **phoeniX** partially reconfigurable platform inludes an `RV32IEM` core designed in Verilog HDL based on the 32-bit Base Instrcution Set of [RISC-V ISA V2.2](http://riscv.org/), with specialized architectural features to support **approximate computing** techniques in a general purpose processor. This platform enables integration of approximate arithmetic circuits at the core level, with different structures, accuracies, timings and etc. without any need for modification in rest of the core, especially in the control logic. This allows configurable trade-offs between perfornmance, application-level quality, and energy efficiency based on user-defined requirements.
